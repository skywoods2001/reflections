How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Only the differences between the two versions of the code are listed. More concise.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy for debug.
    Recovering the old (workable) code if you happen to mess up after changing the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: when automatically saved, you can only preserve the latest version; while for git, 
          you can have the complete editing history
    cons: It's more complicated to go through the history to figure out which commit you need.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because they only need to save the difference between files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Just type these commands.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back to the latest workable version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Everything!
